# Geforce Now OS Switcher
A Chrome extension to unlock Genshin Impact on Geforce now on Linux/Steam Deck

This extension uses the
[declarativeNetRequest](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest)
API to set the `Nv-Device-Os` to `WINDOWS` to bypass the Geforce Now OS checks.
